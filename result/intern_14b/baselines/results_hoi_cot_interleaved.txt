The `cat_2` images predominantly show people holding apples close to their face, often in a smelling or tasting manner, in various settings like outdoors, markets, or casual environments. The `cat_1` images, on the other hand, show apples being used in different contexts, such as being peeled, cut, or held in a more utilitarian manner.\n\nRule: \nThe rule is that `cat_2` images show people holding apples close to their face, often in a smelling or tasting manner, while `cat_1` images show apples being used in more utilitarian or different contexts.\n\n2.

This does not fit the `cat_2` rule of people holding apples close to their face in a smelling or tasting manner. Therefore, it is categorized as `cat_1`.']
